# Configuration for building on ARM64 Windows (e.g., Snapdragon X Elite) with x64 Python
# 
# The .cargo/config.toml target setting does NOT work with maturin's PEP 517 builds.
# Instead, use the environment variable:
#
#   $env:CARGO_BUILD_TARGET = "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
#
# Or on bash/zsh:
#   export CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
#
# Then run: uv run <script.py> or maturin develop
#
# This is needed because maturin bypasses .cargo/config.toml when invoked via PEP 517.

[build]
# This only works for direct cargo commands, not maturin PEP 517 builds
target = "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
